volume = {11},
number = {91},
year = {2014},
doi = {10.1098/rsif.2013.0904},
abstract ={The evacuation of crowds from buildings or vehicles is one example that highlights the importance of understanding how individual-level interactions and decision-making combine and lead to the overall behaviour of crowds. In particular, to make evacuations safer, we need to understand how individuals make movement decisions in crowds. Here, we present an evacuation experiment with over 500 participants testing individual behaviour in an interactive virtual environment. Participants had to choose between different exit routes under the influence of three different types of directional information: static information (signs), dynamic information (movement of simulated crowd) and memorized information, as well as the combined effect of these different sources of directional information. In contrast to signs, crowd movement and memorized information did not have a significant effect on human exit route choice in isolation. However, when we combined the latter two treatments with additional directly conflicting sources of directional information, for example signs, they showed a clear effect by reducing the number of participants that followed the opposing directional information. This suggests that the signals participants observe more closely in isolation do not simply overrule alternative sources of directional information. Age and gender did not consistently explain differences in behaviour in our experiments.},

abstract ={Individuals create cognitive maps based on relationships between cues in the environment. Older individuals are often impaired in wayfinding, especially in environments that lack distinctive features. This study examines how working memory ability in older women is related to wayfinding performance in the presence of salient (distinctive, prominent) or nonsalient cues. The degree of salient cue complexity is also examined, thus leading to the hypothesis that salient, complex cues are important in wayfinding and that working memory capacity is related to wayfinding performance. The virtual computer-generated arena is used to test this hypothesis in 20 healthy older women in three different environmental cue conditions varying in salience and complexity. Data analyses indicate that older women perform best in salient cue conditions. A greater working memory capacity is related to improved performance in the nonsalient cue condition. These findings offer preliminary evidence that cue salience is especially important in wayfinding.},

abstract ={The Health Sciences Centre is a five-story hospital in which each floor is designed with a unique configuration. There are no main corridors in the hospital, nor any corridors that run the complete length of the hospital. Rooms are not rectangular and fail to follow any set pattern. Consequently it is easy to become disoriented in this building. The series of studies reported in this article examined the cognitive mapping systems of student nurses who had worked in the hospital for various periods of time. After inspecting several different measures, it was concluded that the student nurses had failed to form "survy"- type cognitive maps of the building even after traversing it for two years. A control experiment was tested, using naive subjects who were first asked to memorize floor plans of the building. These naive subjects performed significantly better on objective measures of cognitive mapping than did the nurses with two years' experience working at the hospital. It was concluded that mental representations of survey maps do not develop automatically in the complex spatial environment.},

abstract ={One potentially significant yet little investigated criterion for postoccupancy evaluation is the "legibility" of a setting‚Äîthe degree to which a building facilitates the ability of users to find their way within it. The present study evaluated the legibility of a sample of ten university buildings. Self-report data indicated way-finding to be a problem for a substantial minority. The impact upon way-finding of several theoretically derived visual/spatial variables was also assessed. Two aspects of the floor plan configurations of these settings, as judged from highly significant relationships to frequency of disorientation. One of these variables, judged simplicity of floor plan configuration, was able to account for 56% of the variance in these data. One other potentially important variable, respondents' own familiarity with these buildings, was able to account for but 9% of the variance in frequency of disorientation data.},

abstract ={Experts seem to find routes in complex environments by finding a connection from the source to a ‚Äúskeleton‚Äù of major paths, then moving within the skeleton to the neighborhood of the destination, making a final connection to the destination. The authors present a computational hypothesis that describes the skeleton as emerging from the interaction of three factors: (a) The topological map is represented as a bipartite graph of places and paths, where a path is a one-dimensional ordered set of places; (b) a traveler incrementally accumulates topological relationships, including the relation of a place to a path serving as a dividing boundary separating two regions; and (c) the wayfinding algorithm prefers paths rich in boundary relations so they are likely to acquire more boundary relations. This positive-feedback loop leads to an oligarchy of paths rich in boundary relations. The authors present preliminary computational and empirical tests for this hypothesis, and provide initial results.},

fine-grain processing, which yields precision, and categorical processing, which yields proximity. The more uncertain the fine-grain information, the greater the adjustment of estimated location consistent with categori- cal information. , faster decaying fine-grain memory and more robust categorical memory act as a dynamic duo in a somewhat compensatory fashion}

annote = {Tries to and does a good job of formalizing the problem of validation. Also, it highlights the importance of data in validation. And teh difficult in collecting the range and variety of data that is required.

Importantly, it states the issue of having little evacuation data and how this can lie anywhere on the bell curve.

Intersting point, Air evacuation has a lot more data because this sort of data is required to be kept.

It also talks about how an evacuation drillis not the same as an actual evacuation.

Classifies validatino into 4 kinds namely :
1. component validation:

Of the software engineering variety and making sure each component of it works as expected regardless of updates and new features.

done through : SDLC, ISO standards, etc.

2. functional validation :

This requires teh modeller to specify what the model is trying to do, assumnptions being made and also what situations it would be correct to use the simulation in. For eg., queueing overtaking incapacitation, are the modelled? why or why not and to what purpose. Basically , be sure of the functinoalities of the system. The underlying assumption is that you can't make one model that satisfies all requirements and is the be all and end all of all computational models. Someting akin to what Prof Cai said.

done through :conferences, user guides, etc.

3. qualitative validation

The nature of behaviuor produced should be satisfactory.

done through : verification of route taken, and comparison of what we learn through interviews and stuff.

4. quantitative validation

Use data in an accurate way to quantitatively avlidate. Define an envelope of experimental and possible values and if the experimental data is within this envelope then you are good. Else not good. Also mentions historic and prediction.

Done through : quantitative measurement com parisons.}

about the environment. They assume that an agent can access
the entire internal structure of the environment and use graph
search algorithms to perform navigation. Or else they assume
that the environment can be discretized as a grid that stores
potentials or as distance maps that the agents will follow locally
to reach the goal.
It is essential to provide an agent with the ability to explore
partly known environments and learn new features. Another
crucial aspect of crowds that is ignored elsewhere is that people
have the ability to communicate with others in order to
exchange information [21]. It is important therefore to enhance
the current crowd systems with the ability of having realistic
agents that may start their evacuation with only partial
information about the environment and during the simulation
be able to extend their memory (or mental maps) as they explore
the environment and communicate with other individuals in the
crowd. Agents should also exhibit different behaviors based on
different roles. These ideas have currently been introduced in
some systems [20,21] in order to achieve virtual agents driven
by some psychological factors with the purpose of modifying
the overall performance of an individual agent based on its
mental state. I}

The cell and portal representation is an undirected graph. Each edge is a "portal" or a doorway leading from one "cell" or room to the next.

Agents learn about paths either through communication or observation.

Limitation in communication is modeled by limiting communicated information to just two levels of adjacency.  i.e. you only find out about adjoining rooms and whether they connect to exit.

Navigation system uses 2 level motion. Attracter from higher level sent to lower level using social forces.

Impatient agents choose non crowded exits.

We have seen that certain cortical areas, in particu- lar posterior parietal and temporal regions, are critically involved in ob- ject-location memory. We speculate that their contribution bears predominantly on object recognition and spatial encoding factors. Parietal lobes are relevant in computing fine-grained and categorical spatial coordi- nates, lateralized to the right and the left hemisphere, respectively. It should be mentioned that the parietal lobes also are part of a distributed frontoparietal network underlying working memory. We have speculated that the frontal component could process active spatial working memory, whereas the parietal circuit might be more specialized in static visuospatial displays. Bringing all this information together and, moreover, retaining it in a more durable format seems the function of the hippocampal formation. Not only is it involved in binding objects to locations, it also serves to con- struct an absolute, allocentric positional map (independent from what is where).

Are there regions that are activated across different types of spatial information? The answer is likely ``yes,'' given a number of observations. First, although route and survey informa- tion were distinguishable in memory, there were also a number of brain ar- eas that were activated by both route and survey information during encoding (Shelton {\&}amp; Gabrieli, 2002) and retrieval (Mellet et al., 2000). Sec- ond, there is evidence that spatial information from different modalities is integrated in the brain (Andersen, 1997; Banati, Goerres, Tjoa, Aggleton, {\&}amp; Grasby, 2000; Calvert, 2001; Frassinetti, Pavani, {\&}amp; L{\`a}davas, 2002). Indeed, behavioral studies suggest that not only can different sources of spatial memory be integrated but may even be confused in memory (Shelton {\&}amp; McNamara, 2001b

Route knowledge is the knowelge of a route. And path integration is the ability to find the stat point after being moved to some other location through a sequence of steps. Route knowledge is completely dependent on the environment context. Route knowledge is stored in terms of directions at landmarks or choice points. Does not include knowledge of the shape of the trajectory connecting consequetice choice points (but this might be acquired by people). Updating of location related to remote landmarks and knowledge of euclidean distances is more difficult to acquire. But if given no other task, people do indeed acquire a survey knowledge rather than a simple route knowledge. Interestig to note that incidental learning also gives survey knowledge. You don't get survey knowledge if you have to count or do some cognitive task while taking the path.}

Each agent has a state consisting of position health and mobility. Health and mobility range frmo 0-100 and decreases on contact with hazards.

A reaction time (or pre evacuation time) is modeled. Agents in same room have same reaction time. ( in exp. fixed at 10s for the occupants in the room where the fire originates, 20s for those in the other rooms on the same floor and 30s on other floors.

Each agent is given a collaboration factor ranging from [0,1] if the minimu of hte two values is greater than a treshold (arbitrarily fixed at 0.7) and a distance arbitrarily fixed at 1.2 m they collaborate and exhcange information.

An insistence (or inertia) factor of [0,1]. This reduces as efficiency of egress decreases. Strategy adjustments happen only whe nthis is a low enough value. A higher value indicates higher chance of maintaining current strategy.

* Has a basic model of people being unfamilar with the envrionment by considering that unfamilar ppl just have local planning (just next exit) while others have global planning.
* THey use a Floyd Warshall Algorithm which is apparently of cubic comp lexity but this doesn't matter since there are two few nodes.
