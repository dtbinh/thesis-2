Managing crowd egress from buildings is one of the key challenges faced during all kinds of disasters ranging from fires to terrorist attacks to natural disasters like hurricanes and tsunamis that are becoming increasingly common today. Egress modeling and simulation provides an inexpensive, effective and efficient way to analyze and identify the issues that can affect efficient egress in such situations. Several models of crowds and egress have been developed over the years. However, there are still several areas of crowd behavior that have either not been considered in computational models or haven't been analyzed in sufficient enough detail to inspire confidence in their ability to forecast human behavior during an evacuation. This thesis attempts to advance the capabilities of computational models of egress by demonstrating novel models for aspects of egress that are generally not modelled and also by introducing some tools for analyzing and comparing certain aspects of existing models.




Recently, there has been an increasing emphasis on the importance of recognizing the complexity of real world systems~\cite{Arthur:2010uy}. They emphasize the need to model these complexities to have a realistic chance at understanding and predicting what happens in the real world. In recent times, one of the most popular methodologies for tackling this complexity has been through the use of Agent Based Modeling (ABM). An Agent Based Model is made up of multiple heterogeneous intelligent entities known as agents interacting in an environment. The bottom up approach of modeling each agent's behavior often allows the modeler to implement existing theories of individual behavior directly without having to abstract away too many details into an abstract mathematical formula. This approach is generally very useful because it is easier to study and formulate theories at an individual level; apply this theory to model a real world system populated by many such individuals; and finally simulate its working and correctness. Higher level patterns that emerge from this microlevel modeling can be analyzed and studied to learn more things about the system and make predictions. Thus agent based models are ideal for models where there is enough information about the behavior of individual interacting entities.

Crowd simulation is just such an area that has been the subject of a significant amount of multidisciplinary work over the last few decades~\cite{Still:2000tp,Zhou:2010:CMS:1842722.1842725,Gwynne:1999vi}. Its applications range from simulating crowds for movies~\cite{Regelous:2011vt,Reynolds:1987vm} and games~\cite{Snape:2012,ageOfEmpires:2013} to analyzing pedestrian behavior~\cite{PhysRevE.51.4282,Viswanathan:ut,Guy:2010uv} and preparing for fire evacuations and similar emergencies~\cite{Klupfel:2005to,PEDFull:2011,Mordvintsev:2012}. One of the most famous recent applications was in animating large crowds in the award winning movie, Lord of the Rings, which used the commercial software called MASSIVE~\cite{Regelous:2011vt}. Another frequent user of crowd simulation systems is civil defense authorities who make use of these simulations to study, evaluate and formulate strategies for controlling crowds and for tackling emergencies that can emerge. The Sydney Olympics made use of crowd simulation software (LEGION)~\cite{Still:2000tp} to test the facilities for their ability to accommodate crowds and emergency evacuations. Still~\cite{Still:2000tp}, while making the aforementioned LEGION model of crowds, conducted extensive surveys and analyses of videos to accurately model the movement of the crowds.

Even with all the complexity, detail and meticulousness of these models, many psychologists and sociologists are unconvinced about the efficacy and accuracy of the results produced by these simulations~\cite{Aguirre:2004tn,Torres:2010tj,Sime:1995uu}. This is because even the most popular of these models make certain assumptions about human behavior that stand against evidence obtained over the past few decades through extensive studies in the social sciences and humanities~\cite{Torres:2010tj,Sime:1995uu}. Several details of human behavior are wrongly abstracted away, when in fact they actually play a key role in determining the egress dynamics.

% One such example of an abstraction often applied to models of crowds is the perception system used by the modeled humans. More often than not, only a simple visual perception system that perceives all other humans and objects within a certain distance to the agent is used. There are two problems with this approach. The first one is obvious; humans have other methods of observing the environment including aural and olfactory perception. The second problem arises because of a limitation of the human brain. It can only process a limited amount of information at any given point of time. This limitation is something that we come across constantly in our everyday life but which we often fail to notice. For example, while sitting engrossed in reading a book it might take a while before we notice someone calling us. It is also because of this same reason, that we are able to listen and understand someone better if we close our eyes and listen. It is also using this same principle that magicians perform their magic tricks without the audience noticing the trick.

Modeling humans with complete knowledge of the spatial layout of the environment is one such abstraction that is often applied to agent based models of crowds. The limited capacity of the human brain to process information~\cite{Miller:1956tr} at any given time can have a significant effect on the way humans perceive the environment and form their cognitive map and thus their egress route. It can also affect the time taken by a participant to start evacuating because he/she might not know about the fire even if the symptoms are right in front of him/her. This is why it is sometimes mistakenly assumed that people evacuating from a building tend to behave irrationally; while the reality is that they are actually just reacting rationally to the limited information that they have~\cite{Kobes:2009jx,Schadschneider:2008cz,Reicher:2008ep,Torres:2010tj,Paulsen:1984ti,Sime:1983uy}. Ignoring this perceived \emph{irrationality} reduces the reliability of these models.



% Recently, experts in various fields~\cite{Arthur:2010uy} are emphasizing the importance of accepting that most systems in the world are complex systems and the need to model these complexities to have a realistic chance at understanding and predicting what happens in the real world.



% One of the primary reasons for early models like lattice gas models~\cite{Takima:2002wr} and flow models~\cite{Henderson:1974ve} abstracting away details was the  and getting an approximate result in order to get such details as are necessary for that particular application. Advances in hardware have removed many of these constraints. As a result, models have increasingly become more detailed and capable~\cite{Pan:2006vp}.

There have been tremendous advancements in our knowledge of human behavior over the last few decades. However, the majority of the state of the art computational models make assumptions about human behavior without grounding them in the theories and findings from social sciences. Being a very inter-disciplinary field this kind of collaboration is absolutely essential.

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{Intro:ProblemStatement}

Several studies over the past few decades have changed our understanding of human behavior during fire evacuations. Some~\cite{Kobes:2009jx,Schadschneider:2008cz,Reicher:2008ep,Torres:2010tj,Paulsen:1984ti,Sime:1983uy} have shown how humans always behave rationally with the limited information that they have and that humans hardly ever panic and behave irrationally. Torres's thesis~\cite{Torres:2010tj} compared and analyzed the effectiveness of various theories in explaining a real life fire incident.

However, as highlighted by Aguirre~\cite{Aguirre:2004tn}, existing computational models of egress do not take into consideration a lot of these findings. For example, it is still common to model panic/ irrational behavior in evacuating crowds.
 Pre-evacuation behavior and the search for information are two general characteristics of the fire evacuation process that are very rarely considered in egress simulation models. The few computational models of egress that do consider pre-evacuation~\cite{Pires:2005gs,Klupfel:2003wa} behavior are rather simple. In other cases, like the models of human motion and exploration used in existing models, there are several different approaches that have been used but a consistent methodology for their evaluation and validation is lacking. Similarly certains aspects of egress behavior like the effect of partial knowledge have not been studied in much detail.

 To improve the capability of computational models of egress it is necessary to first identify the key buildings blocks of a behavior model. Following this, the shortcomings in each of these blocks can be identified and addressed.


This thesis aims at enhancing the capabilities of existing computation models of egress by proposing novel methods to evaluate and improve core aspects of existing models, and to model certain important aspects that haven't been given their due importance in existing models.
